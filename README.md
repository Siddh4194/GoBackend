# 🧠 Backend System Design Concepts by Siddhant Kadam

Welcome! This repository contains core backend development patterns, real-time architecture, and practical Go/Node.js concepts that I've learned and implemented — explained in a simplified and reusable way.

> 🚫 Note: This repo contains **only generic concepts** and **no private or business-specific code**.  
Everything here is structured to help others (and myself) learn and re-use patterns safely.

## 📌 Why This Repo Exists

While working on real-time systems and scalable microservices, I encountered many reusable ideas and architectural patterns.  
This repo acts as a **public knowledge base**, allowing me to:

- Document learnings cleanly  
- Help others facing similar backend challenges  
- Keep production code private while still showing my expertise
